# Cookies and browser storage

*Last updated November 7, 2026.*

Neither neon1.tech nor the 1NEON portal uses analytics, advertising, or tracking of any kind.

## neon1.tech

The website sets no cookies. Your browser saves two small things, on your device only:

| Saved item | What it's for | How long it lasts |
|---|---|---|
| `neon1.rain` (local storage) | The rain settings you pick: grid or free, the characters, and pause | Until you clear it |
| `neon1.handoff` (session storage) | Lets the portal fade in when you open it from the website | Removed as soon as the portal opens |

## The 1NEON portal

The portal uses only the cookies it needs to sign you in and keep you signed in:

| Cookie | What it's for | How long it lasts |
|---|---|---|
| `__Secure-1neon_at` | Keeps you signed in (access token) | 15 minutes |
| `__Secure-1neon_rt` | Renews your sign-in without asking again | Up to 30 days, or until you sign out. Without "remember me", until you close the browser |
| `__Secure-1neon_step` | Holds a sign-in in progress between steps | 5 minutes |
| `__Secure-1neon_rm` | Remembers your "remember me" choice during sign-in | 5 minutes |
| `__Secure-1neon_flow` | Protects sign-in with Google | 10 minutes |
| Sign-in service cookies on auth.neon1.tech | Protect the sign-in step (Amazon Cognito) | Your sign-in session |

These cookies are strictly necessary, can only be read by the portal's own server, are never used for advertising or analytics, and are never shared. Because of that, the portal doesn't show a cookie consent banner. If you block them, you won't be able to sign in.

The portal also saves, on your device only:

| Saved item | What it's for | How long it lasts |
|---|---|---|
| `1neon.last` (local storage) | Whether you were last signed in, so a reload starts on the right background | Until you clear it |
| `1neon.signin` (session storage) | Your email and the sign-in step in progress, so a reload mid sign-in returns to the code step. The code itself is never saved | 5 minutes, or until the tab closes |
| `neon1.rain` (local storage) | The same rain settings as the website, on the sign-in screen | Until you clear it |

Your other preferences, such as your theme, are saved with your account.

If I ever add optional cookies or storage, such as analytics, I'll update this notice and ask for your consent first.
