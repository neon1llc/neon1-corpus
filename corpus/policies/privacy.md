# Privacy policy

*Last updated November 14, 2026.* This update describes what the signed-in Neo sends to an Anthropic model on Amazon Bedrock when it's turned on, says more carefully what Amazon does and doesn't do with Neo's questions, and says which records are kept on a schedule and which aren't. It also gives neon1's business address. Signatures, issued invoices, and payments are still write-protected for seven years.

neon1 LLC ("neon1", "I", "me") runs the website neon1.tech and the 1NEON client portal at neon1.tech/1NEON. This policy explains what information I collect, why, and what you can do about it.

## The short version

- The website has no analytics, ads, or trackers, and sets no cookies.
- The 1NEON portal stores only what's needed to run your projects with me, and it uses only the cookies that keep you signed in.
- I never sell or rent your information, and I never use it for advertising.

## What I collect

**On the website.** No accounts, analytics, or tracking. Like any website, the servers that deliver it (Amazon CloudFront) handle your IP address and browser details to send you the pages, and AWS may keep them briefly for security and operations. Your browser saves the rain display settings you pick, on your device only. If you use Neo, the assistant on the website and in the portal, your questions are answered by a model (Qwen3 Next 80B) on Amazon Bedrock, in AWS's US East (N. Virginia) region, which writes an answer from neon1's public pages. Neo's service doesn't log or store the text of your questions or its answers; its logs hold only details such as timing, length, and errors. Bedrock's own logging of questions and answers is turned off in my AWS account. To notice the same question sent over and over, Neo keeps a one-way fingerprint of it for ten minutes, and the question limits count visitors by a one-way code, not by IP address. Amazon says Bedrock doesn't use prompts or answers to train models, and that depending on the model and account settings it may keep them for abuse detection; [Amazon's Bedrock documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/data-retention.html) has the details. Please don't type anything sensitive into Neo. The signed-in Neo inside the portal is different, and is used only when it's enabled: when you ask it a question, it sends your question and what it reads in 1NEON as you, such as the projects, items, options, files' names, and comments you can already see, to an Anthropic model on Amazon Bedrock so it can answer. It can't change anything itself; nothing happens until you approve it. It doesn't send anything about organizations you can't see, and it sends nothing when you aren't asking it a question. If you email me or book a call through Calendly, I receive what you send, such as your name, email address, and message. Calendly handles bookings under its own privacy policy.

**In the 1NEON portal**, which is available only to people invited by me or by an administrator of their organization:

- **Account details:** your email address, and optionally your name, job title, phone number, and profile photo.
- **Sign-in data:** your sign-in methods (email codes, passkeys, Google sign-in, an authenticator app, or a password) and security events, such as sign-in times, the IP address and browser used, and when a sign-in method was added or removed. Passwords, passkeys, and email codes are handled by Amazon Cognito, and I never see your password.
- **Authenticator app key:** if you set up an authenticator app, the portal itself creates the app's secret key and keeps it so it can check your 6-digit codes. It's stored in the portal's database, encrypted at rest, read only by the portal's server to check a code, shown to you once during setup and never again, and deleted when you remove the app. An unfinished setup is discarded after 10 minutes.
- **Project content:** what you and your colleagues add to the portal, such as requirements, decisions, tasks, metrics, comments, and files.
- **Activity records:** who changed what and when, kept as an audit trail so both sides have a reliable history of the work.

Please don't put passwords, keys, or other secrets in the portal. The portal is not designed for health, payment, or other regulated personal data, and I won't take on work involving such data until the right agreement (for example, a business associate agreement) is in place.

## How I use it

- To provide the portal: signing you in, showing your organization's projects, and sending the emails you need (invitations, sign-in codes, and notices about the kinds of changes you choose, each of which you can turn off in your profile).
- To keep the portal secure: detecting misuse, investigating incidents, and keeping an audit trail.
- To communicate with you about the work we're doing together.

I don't use your information for marketing, and I don't use automated decision-making that affects you.

**Text messages.** If you add a mobile number and agree to texts in your profile, 1NEON first texts a 6-digit code to that number to confirm it's yours (only a one-way code of it is stored, and it expires in 10 minutes). After that, 1NEON texts you about the kinds of changes you choose, such as file uploads or a project moving stage. Each text says only that something new is waiting, with a link to sign in; it doesn't name your organization, project, or files. Changing your number turns texts off until the new number is confirmed. Message frequency varies with your projects, up to 10 notices a day. Message and data rates may apply. Reply STOP to any text to opt out, or HELP for help, and you can turn texts off in your profile at any time. A STOP reply is recorded on your profile, and turning texts back on needs a new code. Your number and your agreement are used only to send these notices. I never sell or share mobile numbers or text consent with third parties or affiliates for their marketing.

## Who else processes it

I use a small number of service providers, each only for the purpose listed:

| Provider | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Amazon Web Services (United States) | Hosting, storage, sign-in, email and text message delivery, and answers from Neo, the site's assistant |
| Google (Google sign-in, Google Workspace) | Optional sign-in with Google; my business email |
| Calendly | Booking calls from the website |

I disclose information only to these providers, when the law requires it, or to protect the rights and safety of people using neon1's services.

## Where it's stored and how long

Portal data is stored in the United States on AWS, encrypted in transit and at rest. Each organization's data is kept separate from every other organization's.

- **Account and project data:** projects and the files you upload are never deleted on a schedule. They're kept as the record of our work together, including after an engagement ends, so either of us can refer back to it. Your organization can ask me to delete it at any time, and I will, except for the signed and financial records below and anything else the law requires me to keep.
- **System records** are kept for the periods in the items below, which are the only deletion on a schedule.
- **Deleted items:** projects moved to the trash are hidden from everyone but kept, and erased if your organization asks. Deleted files are removed right away. Database backups roll off after 35 days, and earlier copies of deleted or replaced files after 90 days.
- **Signed and financial records:** every signature (an approved option, the service agreement, an accepted handover), issued invoice, and payment is write-protected for seven years from the day it's made (S3 Object Lock), because tax and contract law expect those records kept. Only an administrator with a special permission can shorten that. A deletion request removes everything else, and I tell you in writing which write-protected records remain and when each one expires.
- **Audit records:** the log of sign-ins and changes is kept for up to 3 years, then deleted.
- **Messages on their way:** emails and texts wait in a short queue until they're sent. A record that one was delivered, or that one failed after its retries, is kept for 30 days so I can find and fix delivery problems, then removed.

## Your choices and rights

You can view and update your profile at any time in the portal. You can also ask me to:

- give you a copy of your information, or your organization's data, in a common format;
- correct or delete your information; or
- stop sending you non-essential emails or texts.

Your organization's administrator controls who can access its workspace. If a request concerns your organization's project content, I may need to involve that administrator. I'll respond within 30 days. Depending on where you live, you may have additional rights under laws such as the GDPR or state privacy laws, and you can complain to your local data protection authority.

## Cookies

The website sets no cookies. The portal uses only strictly necessary cookies. See the [cookie and storage notice](https://neon1.tech/1NEON/cookies) for those cookies and what each site saves in your browser.

## Children

neon1's services are for adults and businesses. I don't knowingly collect information from children under 13.

## Changes

If I change this policy in a way that matters, I'll update the effective date and tell portal users by email before the change takes effect.
